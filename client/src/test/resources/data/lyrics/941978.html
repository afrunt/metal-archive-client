	Far beyond the quiet<br />
Where the gods no longer reign<br />
The ice once formed the landscapes<br />
Into mountainsides and stains<br />
Many miles to walk here<br />
Still so many miles to stalk<br />
A place to be remembered<br />
Still the story is untold<br />
<br />
Waiting for the darkness<br />
Lights are soon to disappear<br />
Black clouds in the horizon<br />
Drift away in the open air<br />
A man stands on the hillside<br />
Watching the blackened sky<br />
Memorizing times from another age<br />
Now make his soul and spirit glance like fire<br />
<br />
See the ravens fly there<br />
Circling in the storm<br />
Hidden from the new world<br />
Where the spiritless are born<br />
Watching from his mountain<br />
Stands a man who knows his fate<br />
He who brought the legends<br />
And became a god himself<br />
<br />
Far beyond the stillness<br />
Where the gods no longer reign<br />
The ice once formed the landscapes<br />
<br />
Into mountainsides and stains<br />
The wisdom from the Dark age<br />
He brought forward to tell<br />
The lenghtening in his spirit<br />
Strong he carried his own fate<br />
<br />
