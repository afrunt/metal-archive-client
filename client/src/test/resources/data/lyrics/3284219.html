	Fire of hate burning bright inside<br />
Without any rational explanation<br />
So many years, as long as I remember<br />
Who the hell am I reincarnation of?<br />
<br />
Instincts of a serpent that compel<br />
No love rains into this hiding lair<br />
<br />
Born once again into this limbless form<br />
I must shed my old skin of enslavement<br />
Grow a thick armour against wind and ice<br />
A mask to conceal my intent<br />
<br />
Poisonous gland secured from the bloodstream<br />
Filled to the brim to kill a human victim<br />
I'll bite you in a flash when you try to feed me<br />
And devour your flesh instead<br />
<br />
Slithering spirit awaiting restless<br />
Aching to vomit the black bile<br />
Targets set not by a selfish plan<br />
But an enigmatic anger even I don't comprehend<br />
<br />
Poisonous gland secured from the bloodstream<br />
Filled to the brim to kill a human victim<br />
I'll bite you in a flash when you try to feed me<br />
And devour your flesh instead<br />
<br />
Fire of hate burning bright inside<br />
Without any rational explanation<br />
So many years, as long as I remember<br />
What the hell am I reincarnation of?
