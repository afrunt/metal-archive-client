	See the bloodstained grass as it burns.<br />
Throw forth your hand to me.<br />
Fields of glowing cables against the night sky.<br />
Funny how you speak to me, with your poison tongue.<br />
Killer, as I scratch at the cold stone.<br />
Killer, it crumbles to my knees.<br />
I still kept you alive.<br />
But you buried me when you gave in to denial, so far astray.<br />
Burned by the words left unsaid.<br />
I'm holding on to the scripts you ressurected.<br />
Saved by something you canâ€™t see - it's in the air,<br />
it's in the earth, and it rests inside the hearts of the dying.<br />
Killer, as I scratch at the cold stone.<br />
Killer, it crumbles to my knees.<br />
I still kept you alive,<br />
but you killed and killed and killed again,<br />
killed, killed again, killed.
