	Screams of burning tounges, arise from the depths<br />
words that echo through the world, salvation has come<br />
manifest the serpent form; writhing, ancient scales<br />
a deity in glory, illumination has come<br />
<br />
Embrace the cloven kiss<br />
enlightened by is grace<br />
reborn in cleansing flames<br />
engulfed in the serpent salvation<br />
<br />
<br />
Demolish and defile, reform and reconstruct<br />
drink the blood of hypocrites a feast for the bastard son<br />
clasp ones hands in prayer, waiting for the sign<br />
the sign to to thy biddings in the name of the swarm<br />
<br />
Embrace the cloven kiss<br />
enlightened by is grace<br />
reborn in cleansing flames<br />
engulfed in the serpent salvation<br />
<br />
<br />
Majestic Lord who dwells in the depths <br />
ascend and come forth to give unholy strength <br />
Let the infidels burn in a searing torment<br />
diabolical flames rape their foul christian flesh<br />
<br />
<br />
Cast out the false prophet, agitator of light<br />
make him crawl in feces and vermin with his beloved whore<br />
esoteric empire, built on the corpse of christ<br />
its fundaments, chained in time to reign eternally<br />
<br />
<br />
Majestic Lord who dwells in the depths <br />
ascend and come forth to give unholy strength <br />
Let the infidels burn in a searing torment<br />
diabolical flames rape their foul christian flesh
