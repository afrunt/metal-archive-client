	I carry on catenated by infinite obscurity. <br />
Infringing upon the light, sculpting my somber dominion.<br />
Shrouded landscapes scourged by foolish mortals<br />
From the bleakness of this domain, enthroned I shall be!<br />
Centuries decompose, forever buried and forgotten in time. <br />
Man falls breathless, dissolving into the weeping macrocosm.<br />
But I persist to necessitate abysmal rest upon iniquitous men,<br />
to cloak abstruse and ancient powers, <br />
trailed by darkness - dispelling day! <br />
Forever perpetuating my name onto the lips of the horizon! <br />
<br />
(A new and waning moon, the beneficiant powers created to count the years of men)
