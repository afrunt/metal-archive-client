	Voices of a thousand tongues,<br />
Permeates the air, fouling<br />
My sanity, my sanctity.<br />
<br />
The alien-ness, you are martian,<br />
Copulating on dignified ground,<br />
Polluting what little purity,<br />
Putrefying chronic barbarians.<br />
Usurping rightful appanage,<br />
Filthy blasphemous rot.<br />
<br />
Tyrant to abdicate, Cronies, eviscerate.<br />
Rejoice in sanity, eradicate this fiefdom.<br />
Emancipate my people, and apotheosize.<br />
<br />
Excoriate delinquent politicians,<br />
A horror house of moiety,<br />
Looming chasm of fawning obeisance,<br />
Nugatory citizens, unctuous aliens.
