	This is the time of blind revelry. Their eyes all reflecting obscenity. I snake between dense carcass seas. Only to find I have no leave. Will this be my fight? To teach men of their rights. Fire skates the water. Illusion thine religion. Fire skates the water. Never trust the second hand. Laughing now with painful echo. Someone lays drunk beside their angel devil. Pissing out your soul in the night. The bottle is done and your fears have won. Fire skates the water. Illusion thine religion. Fire skates the water. Never trust the second hand. Light. Waves too dark to focus my light. Oceans, now fires. My beach crystalline ash. I race to the light sinking time. Fire in the waves now. Lost is your savior. Time is your slave now. Lost. We all falling down. Fire skates the water. Illusion thine religion. Fire skates the water. Never trust the second hand. Will this be my fight? To teach men of their rights. Laughing now with painful echo. Someone lays drunk beside their angel devil. Pissing out your soul in the night. The bottle is done and your fears have won. And your fears have won. I race to the light sinking time.
