	When a big sun dies, when it blows up<br />
Space spread all its light, like wind with dust<br />
<br />
Light is carrying me, it tells me something<br />
I can’t hear no words, just know it all<br />
<br />
You don’t be afraid<br />
Finally comes<br />
Gifted you will<br />
Forever and again<br />
<br />
Dark illusions<br />
Must be punished<br />
We, the saviors<br />
Soul raiders on the role<br />
<br />
From the hell’s core<br />
From the heavens<br />
Who the fuck cares<br />
The eternal quest remain<br />
<br />
Within the time<br />
Raised and still doing<br />
We, death prophets<br />
The wildcards of the gods<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Beyond this gate<br />
Where Demons await<br />
I’m sinking in the dreams<br />
That they’ve made for me<br />
<br />
It’s weird, and hard<br />
Say goodbye to mind<br />
And spin like a wheel<br />
In those alleys of time<br />
<br />
Fall, you down!<br />
Your conscience will drown<br />
One instant of memories<br />
Through eons got lost<br />
<br />
The state of grace<br />
That, chased by human race<br />
Wanders in cosmos<br />
Awaiting for me<br />
<br />
No way, do not fear the fear itself<br />
Now, chance to beat it<br />
Once and for all! (x3)<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
It’s said and sealed<br />
Our reached fate unseen…<br />
Crawling and crawling<br />
To jump from the cliff<br />
<br />
This plot, this act<br />
We’re all in, in fact<br />
Don’t be afraid of this masterpiece craft<br />
<br />
A small spark of wisdom in memory breeds<br />
My own little piece of immortality
