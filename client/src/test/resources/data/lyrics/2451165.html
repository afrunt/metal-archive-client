	Under old pine trees - men dressed in wolf skin <br />
We the summoned are here to enthrone their mires and rocks <br />
<br />
My creed turned to wrath, <br />
my breath to break the morning calm, <br />
my rage to tear their souls apart, <br />
and my sword to make them serve man-blood <br />
<br />
I swore a foreign oath, for what? <br />
Words that will be compromised, <br />
greed sheathed in hallowed illusion. <br />
Creeds proclaimed in apostate ways. <br />
<br />
Their blood will enrich the blooming <br />
of the cold flowers in summer’s breeze, <br />
Worship thy domain; you are not less than them, <br />
veiled with pitch-black stratagem. <br />
Now, a desolate and silent domain serenely lies in wait, <br />
Sown are the seeds of growth, <br />
solemn thoughts, yet profound. <br />
<br />
You are not alive, you do not exist, <br />
You are a withered garden - <br />
Spiritless and soul-less, a dead man walking. <br />
<br />
White flowers turn blue - <br />
covered in dry blood, blooming under a crescent moon <br />
His arrival has been marked. <br />
A war into the wolves’ lairs is set to start
