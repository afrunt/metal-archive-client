	Turn to me, see my tears,<br />
this season falls dark again, <br />
your rubine eyes cut through me, <br />
i feel your sulfuric breath. <br />
Live with this sickness for a lifetime. <br />
Wake from your bed of broken glass. <br />
Kill your grace for just one moment.<br />
Pray that this plague will go away. <br />
Tear into me with talons soaked in rain. <br />
These deep winter scars seal my veins. <br />
Sift through the pieces in hellenistic severance. <br />
Devotions design fosters rabid consequence. <br />
A xerox of the years gone by. <br />
And notes from centuries past. <br />
Scrape the serum from my tongue, a crime, in the name of all. <br />
Warm your hand on what runs from my veins, <br />
my hands they1ve not moved a single inch today, <br />
I've failed, I just move on.
