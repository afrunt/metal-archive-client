	You must pray, then, this way.<br />
Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.<br />
<br />
Let your kingdom come.<br />
Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.<br />
<br />
Give us today our bread for this Day.<br />
<br />
闇色した蟲惑で罪な天鵞絨の波に溺れていた悪夢<br />
<br />
And forgive us our Debts, as we also have forgiven our Debtors.<br />
And do not bring us into temptation,<br />
but Deliver us from the wicked one.<br />
<br />
穏やかな陽射しを遮る凍える滅びのカーテン<br />
描いた心映す私の肖像画が塗り潰されてゆく…　黒く<br />
Distort my face<br />
<br />
Pray to God<br />
<br />
イカレタ闇が悪徳求め　鼻孔と鼓膜の中まで<br />
犯されてゆく　視界と理性…　見果てぬ夢と知りながら…<br />
<br />
Everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, praying<br />
God the Father through him.<br />
「Amen」
