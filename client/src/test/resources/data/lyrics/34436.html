	Slipping, tearing, these scars were never meant to heal. <br />
Plunging back and forth, <br />
I'd rather watched this all burn down. <br />
Forged in flesh, read like a book on how to hate, and hate,. <br />
We kill from the inside out in seasons of suffocation. <br />
Calvary of consequence aligned by a sacred vow. <br />
Live today and die for denial, <br />
we kill from the inside out. <br />
Our monospaced lives and algorithmic suffering leave us crawling onward <br />
to a place where names and lives are lost. <br />
These bodies left to hang in the stench of millions more.<br />
forward we march into suffocation. <br />
In seasons of suffocation, <br />
we kill from the inside out.
