	Following one's steps into the night too far<br />
To dissolve a thread that themselves are<br />
A liken seeking blame in blind<br />
No change in sight with the ill set of mind<br />
<br />
When the hate turns to rage<br />
When the black seeks light in grey<br />
The order of the seers -<br />
all as predicted, to no avail<br />
<br />
For I am the night,<br />
the sole survivor in fear,<br />
The one to judge them doom<br />
The leader of blind legions<br />
Liberation of earthly demons<br />
In the hood of the clan of tombs<br />
<br />
First they deceived all and themselves -<br />
inviting the devil to a masquerade<br />
Drinking from their victories,<br />
or what they had appeared to be
