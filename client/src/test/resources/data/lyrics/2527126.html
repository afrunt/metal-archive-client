	I watch all like in dreams<br />
The never seenâ€¦<br />
And the eyes look around, to the unknown<br />
To a dark hole, where fears sure will be proved<br />
<br />
For sure, or not<br />
Perception and wit still being gone<br />
No time, no facts<br />
Not yet created, so far<br />
Show must go on<br />
Stuck when implosion burn cosmos all-wide<br />
<br />
Blasting away from the stars<br />
Fading in drops,<br />
As gleam light rain falls<br />
<br />
Within the walls now created into this space<br />
The inception of being leads to life<br />
<br />
I can just run on that light speed pipe<br />
Blessing and gazing those wonders alive<br />
<br />
Between the void and the nothing, the Gods leave<br />
And spirit of time claim its own right to be<br />
<br />
[Chorus](x2)<br />
Little pupils on the universe shout<br />
The Iris so dark is, will laugh at us the hounds<br />
Immortality promised all along<br />
Stay reach the end and the light will turn on<br />
<br />
Immortality, vanity for soul<br />
Promise in decline when the master takes control<br />
<br />
Origin, prodigy, wonderment, glow for me<br />
Where the sun brings the path<br />
Back and forth within time<br />
Go ahead, from inside<br />
<br />
Where the stars will collide<br />
Back and forth into light<br />
<br />
Claim Your Right To Be!
