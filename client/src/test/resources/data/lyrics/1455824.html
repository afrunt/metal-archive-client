	(With an empty chair by the firelight,<br />
I will remember how the Einherjar and<br />
their lords will fall. A new Earth will rise-<br />
bathed in light...)<br />
<br />
The fires of Surtr will subside<br />
once all in Ymir's skull has burned.<br />
Idavoll lays cold and barren;<br />
lifeless, limitless - it unfolds.<br />
<br />
(Invisible testaments - to glory and<br />
honor - haunt the fields in silence...)<br />
<br />
The son and daughter of Heimdall<br />
will emerge from a great wood -<br />
spared mercifully from the flames<br />
and being nourished by the morning<br />
dew.<br />
<br />
Where the height of Bifrost will shatter,<br />
Vidar and VÃ¡li live on!<br />
<br />
We can only pray,<br />
trust the runes,<br />
that we may die a glorious death!<br />
<br />
We can only wait,<br />
watch for the portents!<br />
We must ready our shields and spears!<br />
For the journey to the hall on high!<br />
<br />
(The Aesir will assemble once more,<br />
Loki begetting the demon, snake, wolf and giant -<br />
we will see soon the monstrous winter!)
