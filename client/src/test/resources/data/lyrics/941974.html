	Clear sights through the depths I ride<br />
Inside my mind the thoughts I hide<br />
I ought to bear my existence<br />
And burn to be...<br />
<br />
The visions that was brought to me<br />
Not different from my fantasy<br />
Between two worlds I am<br />
Quested not to be<br />
<br />
I ride beyond the realms of the past<br />
I see the sights of what won't last<br />
From the blinding daylight<br />
To the utter dark<br />
<br />
The golden winter blows a breeze<br />
Not different from my fantasies<br />
Dark and light far in sight<br />
Quested not to be<br />
<br />
Too long I have dwelled in the shadows<br />
Too long I have slept in the shades<br />
Too long I have searched the desires<br />
Release me so I can awake<br />
<br />
Stone cold in the soul<br />
With nothing to return to<br />
<br />
Between two worlds<br />
Between two worlds<br />
<br />
Clear sights through the depths I ride<br />
Inside my mind the thoughts I hide<br />
I ought to bear my existence<br />
And burn to be...<br />
<br />
The visions that was brought to me<br />
Not different from my fantasies<br />
Between two worlds I am<br />
Quested not to be
