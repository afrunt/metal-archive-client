	Blinded by a false savoir  <br />
that seemed so divine in nature <br />
putting all my faith in<br />
to find it all spent for nothing<br />
You stood to watch me fall<br />
you tried to hide it away from me<br />
you tried to take it all<br />
even tear away my dignity <br />
 <br />
To think I knew you better to think I knew you well<br />
when all along you deceived me as you dragged me through hell<br />
 <br />
Fooled by words of a traitor<br />
that seemed so truthful in nature<br />
finding I was mistaken<br />
and found it all spent for nothing<br />
You stood to watch me fall<br />
you tried to hide it away from me<br />
and tried to take all<br />
even tear away my dignity <br />
 <br />
To think I knew you better to think I knew you well<br />
when all along you deceived  me as you dragged me through hell<br />
to think I knew you better I knew you fucking well<br />
When all along your the one who dragged me through hell<br />
 <br />
I believed<br />
I believed that you would never betray me<br />
I believed that you could never deceive me<br />
 <br />
Still I could never truly see how hate could replace this<br />
convinced not to Believe that you would betray me<br />
sins still not made confessed the truth not embraced yet<br />
regret made out of trust by words of the heartless <br />
 <br />
Dragged meâ€¦<br />
you dragged me through hell  <br />
you dragged me through hell  <br />
you dragged me
