	Nevir, Nevir, Nevir, won’t you let me sever. Keeping me on a withering sphere. Mingling with a billion seasons of suffocation. Kismet. I saw the shape. I saw that gruesome face in mine, on mine. I feel his name should end. Nevir. I’ve met your daughter. Kismet, silent saboteur. Kimset comes of age. Nevir, I’ve met your daughter, Kismet betrayer, truthsayer. Nevir, Nevir, where’s the end of the river. Deep waters await me ahead. Pushing past skeletal minefields tonight. Who blows my sail. And to what avail. Feeding us to us. Bleeding to bone. Killing time. Killing Space. Killing my grace. The hand that helped me. I thought I saw his tortured face. Kismet comes of age. Out of the way. Kismet comes of age. Kismet comes of age. Betrayer. Truthsayer. Kismet comes of age! Nevir, Nevir, let me sever. Keeping me on a withering sphere. Mingling with seasons of suffocation. Nevir, Nevir, won’t you leave me. Killing me, bleeding to sea. Mingling with seas of suffocation. Killing time. Killing Space. Killing my grace. The hand that helped me. Feeding us to us. Bleeding tone bone. Kismet sees the mask before her dying. Kismet sees the mask before her dying. For not.
