	Pawns of crime and disease. Santa Muerte keeping their hearts beating. The wrists of the prostitute saint have finally stopped bleeding. The city’s at war. The priest locks the car door. The wolves of the city are feeding. Gun in his hand. Open up old man. Saint Death has cut me a deal. The match hit the ground and the man dropped his keys. Tequila soaked priest set to burn. Crying out to his lord, his sister, his god. No candle will burn in your honor. Pawns of crime and disease. Santa Muerte keeping their hearts beating. The wrists of the prostitute saint have finally stopped bleeding. Holy wine burning him inside. Blessed the soul cried the man as his sister died. Pennies placed in the eyes of the prostitute saint. A one-hundred-year curse is gone. The priest swore to his lord, “Vindicta Santa Muerte!” The priest swore to his lord, “Vindicta Santa Muerte!” Gun in his hand. Open up old man. A saint dies in Chinatown.
