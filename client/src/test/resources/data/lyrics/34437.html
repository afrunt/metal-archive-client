	I've seen their frozen lives, <br />
I know that I've been there before and something tells me that I'm still alive. <br />
And those were the days the rains came, <br />
they left me looking down from above, <br />
as I watched it all die. <br />
Some things never change, you came running, <br />
screaming that you buried it for good. <br />
Under gods of sullen suns you live in pain, <br />
as keeper of this frozen divide of sanguine skies. <br />
One by one at shoulders1 length we taste the pain. <br />
I stand before one million souls in vein, and I am falling down. <br />
Some things never change, you came running, <br />
screaming that you buried it for good. <br />
