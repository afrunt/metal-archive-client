	Gazing into the void<br />
Trifling hidden screams<br />
I am purified<br />
And I feel no soul<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for real<br />
I don't know what was<br />
It feels that I have lost<br />
The breath of life's flow<br />
<br />
How I wished to be endless<br />
Now I wish to be dead<br />
I have only one more request<br />
Mark every word that I have said
