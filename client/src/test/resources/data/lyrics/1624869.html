	Cosmic Inferno, invocation to thee! <br />
Vengeance that calls me forth from the dawning of eternity!<br />
Smite thy deceiver cast into darkness!<br />
Burning, writhing beneath the serpent's kiss. <br />
An avenger is born - birthed from the ashes of retribution!<br />
Treacherous, scornful existence. <br />
Shedding the waterless tears that bound him in darkness. <br />
The sunrise that came whispered your name,<br />
Through the decaying of time, the afflication of loss - <br />
your radiance exudes the bleakest of sorrows. <br />
Life dissolves.
