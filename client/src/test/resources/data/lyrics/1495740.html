	Intro:<br />
Let the earth tremble as we trample the living and foul, our putrid stench and rotten breath will eclipse the sun, its the era of sickness and death and a new world order. undead - SERVE YOUR MASTERS!<br />
<br />
<br />
In the sign of death, we march towards the holy life<br />
our flag held high, it bears the mark of our skull <br />
in the sign of stench, hear our moans and hear our cries<br />
the cries of war, a war that you living have feared so long<br />
<br />
Sharpen your teeth, grind your nails and peel your skin<br />
fill in our ranks, all from rotten to deseased<br />
the loss of limbs, compensated by our reeking hate<br />
your time has come, there will be no more life<br />
<br />
The scent of flesh, our hunger burns like raging flames<br />
it guides our steps and shows us where we'll find the whore<br />
the whore of life, that you love and worship on all fours<br />
<br />
<br />
Undead War, will rain upon you<br />
your tender flesh will quench our thirst<br />
millions of corpses march behind us<br />
It's us that they obey, as slaves to the decay<br />
<br />
<br />
In the name of filth, we crawl like maggots in the corpse<br />
destroy all things, like a sickness we devour all<br />
in the name of plague contaminated soldiers march<br />
to break the chains that keep us from our rotten world<br />
<br />
Now it's time to raise the banner with death's head<br />
go out in war and tear your limbs, shred by shred<br />
since we're dead, we will never ever know defeat<br />
our army grows with each living that we take from you<br />
<br />
The scent of flesh, our hunger burns like raging flames<br />
it guides our steps and shows us where we'll find the whore<br />
the whore of life, that you love and worship on all fours<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Undead War, will rain upon you<br />
your tender flesh will quench our thirst<br />
millions of corpses march behind us<br />
It's us that they obey, as slaves to the decay<br />
<br />
Undead War, will rain upon you<br />
your tender flesh will quench our thirst<br />
millions of corpses march behind us<br />
It's us that they obey, as slaves to the decay
