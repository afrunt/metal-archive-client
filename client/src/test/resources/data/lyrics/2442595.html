	My Dear rose. You are all of me in this world.<br />
In now, the past, and the future. I sing for you.<br />
<br />
奈落の底　地を這う声　闇より暗い慟哭のアカペラ<br />
心満たす　天に降る声　薔薇より赤い情熱のアリア<br />
<br />
I never know pleasure to live.<br />
Why was I born such ugly?<br />
(Why?) (You wish?) (Your mind?)<br />
<br />
一度だけ愛されてみたい　この醜い仮面の下までも<br />
この世に生まれて愛を知らずに闇に包まれたままで...<br />
<br />
You must choose! Come with me!<br />
<br />
Nobody can stop me!<br />
<br />
I never know pleasure to live.<br />
Why was I born such ugly?<br />
(Why?) (You wish?) (Your mind?)<br />
<br />
灯火だけ熱く胸焦す　愛の終わり忘れはしないから<br />
さあ行くがいい　ずっと君が光に包まれる様に...<br />
<br />
If you will forget, but even so I will remember forever and ever.<br />
<br />
My Dear rose. You are all of me in this world.<br />
In now, the past, and the future. I sing for you.<br />
<br />
この世に生まれて愛を知らずに闇に包まれたままで...
