	As the snow fell silent on barren land,<br />
Balith strode toward the north<br />
leaving ruins behind him<br />
his ambition the highest peak<br />
<br />
His hatred welling within<br />
he must avenge his fallen kin<br />
<br />
blade cries for blood<br />
darkened clouds weeping their sorrows<br />
winds howling cold<br />
and death to him rode near!<br />
<br />
visions bleak, horizons cold<br />
he surveys the land as they unfold<br />
skies above - dripping black<br />
behold to him there's no turning back<br />
<br />
his eyes of blacket fire!<br />
his spirit writhes on funeral pyre!<br />
<br />
blade cries for blood,<br />
darkened clouds weeping their sorrow,<br />
winds howling cold,<br />
and death to him rode near!<br />
frigid air chilling bones<br />
the pathways growing steep<br />
steel at his side<br />
as he reaches the final peak!<br />
<br />
vengeance led and hatred born,<br />
memories return of thoughts forlorn,<br />
a village destroyed, a family killed<br />
path for redemption, a quest fullfilled!<br />
<br />
blade cries in FURY!<br />
approaching the beast!
