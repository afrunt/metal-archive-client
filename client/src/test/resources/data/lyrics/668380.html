	Kissed By the Serpent <br />
<br />
The sweetest thing, you'll ever see<br />
lifts you up, high above the trees<br />
The touch so soft, like morning sun<br />
hunts your nightmares on the run <br />
<br />
A gentle smile, gleam in the eye<br />
sends a cold shiver down your spine<br />
The smell of lust and raging desire<br />
burns your mind like the hottest fire<br />
<br />
Sadistic demons, in disguise<br />
wicked angels here for your demise<br />
Dressed in innoecence with lips so red<br />
wicked angels here to see you dead<br />
<br />
<br />
A subtle kiss by a cloven tounge<br />
like a drug it makes you numb<br />
Razor scales that shreds your flesh<br />
in an embrace that certifies death<br />
<br />
Skin like silk, pale as the moon<br />
you dig your grave and bring down your doom<br />
Kneedeep in pain and agony<br />
she slits your wrists and watch you bleed<br />
<br />
The things you thought would be so good<br />
ruined your life, before you understood<br />
ripped out your heart and drank your soul<br />
draining your life and turned you cold<br />
<br />
Sadistic demons, in disguise<br />
wicked angels here for your demise<br />
Dressed in innoecence with lips so red<br />
wicked angels here to see you dead<br />
<br />
<br />
A subtle kiss by a cloven tounge<br />
like a drug it makes you numb<br />
Razor scales that shreds your flesh<br />
in an embrace that certifies death
