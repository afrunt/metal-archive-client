	Shapeless, apathetic<br />
No conscience of time<br />
Tabula Rasa!<br />
My feelings wither<br />
Memories don’t hurt anymore<br />
Home of hopeless<br />
Slaves of chance<br />
The voiceless ones<br />
Tabula Rasa!<br />
I could not say how many winters<br />
Have taken this cursed place<br />
<br />
Can you see my eyes?<br />
How dull and sad they look?<br />
You, lord of the void<br />
You left me to your realm of emptiness!<br />
Sand will deicide<br />
How lengthy will be my wait on here<br />
<br />
No good, no evil<br />
Here’s no place for this matter<br />
Just miles of nothingness<br />
I become disheartened<br />
<br />
I raise my hands<br />
They both lay bare<br />
Choose my fate<br />
Since you took my will so long ago<br />
<br />
I beg you, don’t blame me<br />
You put me into weakness<br />
My sins and my passions<br />
Were preceding me in the past<br />
I Cry! Oh I Cry!<br />
<br />
You show disdain for me<br />
Stare at me! Point at me!<br />
Shattered hopes, destroyed dreams<br />
This limbo beat my faith<br />
<br />
So it’s time to weed out all your mistakes<br />
To take a new chance.<br />
Rise from your fall, crush your limits<br />
And Cross The Line!<br />
Tabula Rasa!
