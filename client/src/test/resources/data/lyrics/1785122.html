	One hundred and twenty degrees. The walls in this room are laughing at me. Two minutes to midnight, i’m gonna break from this disease. Every night i’m reliving the day the enemy shot me down. Men in the jungle screaming. The sound i hear as the bodies hit the ground. Black helicopter in sight. The day becomes the night. The night becomes the rest of my life. Killing them. Taking life. Get on your fucking knees. A voice in the room whispers to me. Two minutes to midnight, i’m gonna break from this disease. Every night i’m reliving the day the enemy shot me down. Men in the jungle screaming. The sound i hear as bodies hit the ground. Every night i’m reliving the day my country shot me down. Men in the city screaming. The sound i hear as bodies hit the ground. Black helicopter in sight. The day becomes the night. The night becomes the rest of my life. Killing them. Taking life. The years waste away. Tonight i crawl and hide. I’m on fire on the inside.
