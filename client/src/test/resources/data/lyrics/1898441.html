	To cross the Rubicon<br />
And choose to solve the unsolved<br />
To break boundaries<br />
And be bound to the path of the vertices<br />
<br />
I am nothing, yet I am all<br />
One over infinity - watch them fall<br />
Equal to none, infinite chaotic God<br />
A complex universe - parallel entropy<br />
<br />
I am the one without end<br />
Unbound - existence<br />
A Xeper's leaf, wine of life<br />
Blood and soul, one of a kind - all<br />
<br />
The final curtain of death<br />
A sealed gateway to life<br />
The meaning and the essence<br />
Of becoming alive
