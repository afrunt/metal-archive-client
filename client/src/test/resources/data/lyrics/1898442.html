	What is left for those who survive physical dying<br />
A universe or a black hole to never arrive in<br />
A limbo state at the corner of a dark world<br />
The phlegmatic joy in knowing the path to more<br />
And to nothing at all<br />
<br />
We live; we die, returning to the hereafter<br />
Do wee seek to exist, or to hide behind one another?<br />
<br />
Us - via negative, devils for the cause<br />
Blood on his claws<br />
I - the eye, watchman of the triangle<br />
And unrestricted wisdom<br />
<br />
You who like to be watched but have not yet been observed - <br />
Unveil the shadow world
