	We dig in the dirt<br />
'til our nails and fingers they bleed<br />
try to reach the six feet barrier<br />
the depth that satisifes our needs<br />
<br />
The graveyard is our brothel<br />
and the corpses are our whores<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The face of an angel<br />
rotten down to the grin of a demon<br />
hollow eyes that gaze at me<br />
fills my heart with lust and need<br />
<br />
This is my bride tonight<br />
she fulfils my dreams in the pale moonlight<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Live a life in shame and disgrace, with a hunger for my dead delight<br />
With a shovel in my hand <br />
my urge to dig up graves, satisfy me and give peace to my inner fight<br />
reaching for the damned<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The stench of death<br />
to me is a lovely, sweet perfume<br />
how I feel you won't understand<br />
to find my love, I need to exhume<br />
<br />
Living love is such a lie<br />
true love's seen in cadaver eyes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With a shovel in my hand - reaching for the damned<br />
one thing that gives me bliss - decomposing of an orifice
