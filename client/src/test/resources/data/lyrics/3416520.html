	Cosmic seizures, the awakening of the great abyss<br />
Insanity, like wildfire will spread mortality, manifested in your rotting flesh<br />
Emptiness as you drown in the pit<br />
Inferior beings, whose purpose is fulfilled in death<br />
Grand reaping, like tidal waves through the universe<br />
Harvest souls, the nurture of the end to come<br />
Cataclysmic implosion embrace the end<br />
Decreation of the universe<br />
The death of everything, to spawn forth the unholy rebirth<br />
Ancient rites, chanted in forgotten tongue<br />
Sacrifice nothing can help you now<br />
Unearthly terror, succumb to gods lost in time<br />
Pitch black chaos will devour you all<br />
With claws like swords, rip your sanity to shreds<br />
Torment your soul, existential horror<br />
Rape your mind, drag its carcass through all worlds<br />
All must kneel, decreation has begun<br />
Decreation of the universe<br />
The death of everything, to spawn forth the unholy rebirth<br />
Decreation of the universe<br />
Time itself unravels<br />
Ashes to ashes and earth to earth<br />
Atoms collide, everything dies<br />
Space implodes, everything dies<br />
Matter dissolves, everything dies<br />
Light ceases, everything dies
