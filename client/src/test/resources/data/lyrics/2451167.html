	As complete you step towards the empty <br />
One last tragedy, but not for you to face the aftermath <br />
You've been on this path before <br />
and seen that all forks lead to the same place <br />
No place of solace will comfort you enough <br />
No will to proceed to what is left to live for <br />
<br />
Strengthened by surroundings, unknown to the rest. <br />
Yet given to all - one escapes! <br />
No cries for help, only attempts to comprehend <br />
No safe harbor, not within yourself. <br />
None is to change what will be death <br />
No ground to understand. No will to live by demand <br />
<br />
Only one way to cope with it all, <br />
but not enough to turn the course <br />
Darkness seems not to end. <br />
It is a stagnant orbit in nil <br />
Only short moments of delight, <br />
on a pathway to the endless night <br />
This is how it will remain; this is how it will end <br />
<br />
One more effort, born out of that ever-growing pain <br />
One last embrace of the dark that is written on our graves <br />
One more to remember, one more with a complete name <br />
For now that it is closed, all chapters unveiled <br />
<br />
What bounded us once, has found itsâ€™ way to us again <br />
And all that there is an image set slowly to fade away <br />
What once was real, was a pilgrimage to end this in a better way <br />
But now that it is done, it all seems to make sense anyway <br />
<br />
And all that there is now, memories and acts of the past <br />
No need to take words back - this is what we will have <br />
One more to remember, one more with a complete name <br />
For now that it is closed, all chapters unveiled
