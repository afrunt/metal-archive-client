	Fire, burns. Fire, burns. Fire, Burns. <br />
<br />
 You danced with the devil. <br />
 Now your soul is bruised and scarred. <br />
 There ain't no pride and dignity. <br />
 We've been down the rusty boulevard. <br />
 You lived your life, thought you'd be immortalized. <br />
 The moral of your story, what goes up must come back down. <br />
<br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever. <br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever More. <br />
<br />
 A moment of silence. <br />
 Just before you hit the stage. <br />
 This is your day of reckoning. <br />
 To pay back all the dues and turn the page. <br />
 You hit rock bottom and you stood the count to ten. <br />
 Came back to harvest glory, now your star will shine forever. <br />
<br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever. <br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever More. <br />
<br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever. <br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever More. <br />
<br />
 'Cause every step, the light races follow. <br />
 'Cause every move we make, might be our last mistake. <br />
<br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever. <br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever More. <br />
<br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever. <br />
 Fire, burns. <br />
 The Fire Burns Forever More. <br />
<br />
 Fire, fire, burn.
