	We're here to raise hell and to piss on your grave<br />
tear down everything you believe in<br />
we put back the laughter in slaughter<br />
crush our opponents and let them lie there bleeding<br />
<br />
This is the new way, this is the new world<br />
bow down, cause we're black metal punks<br />
we are the new lords, you'll follow our laws<br />
bow down, cause we're black metal punks<br />
<br />
Leave the world in ruins and ashes<br />
rebuilding all that were once destroyed<br />
creating armies of vermin and locust<br />
to do our deeds when the sun rises no more<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the new way, this is the new world<br />
bow down, cause we're black metal punks<br />
we are the new lords, you'll follow our laws<br />
bow down, cause we're black metal punks<br />
<br />
<br />
We are here to make this fucking statement<br />
grand rebellion and reeking ideals<br />
obstruct, destroy, hate and resent<br />
your sick blood flows, oh how good it feels<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the new way, this is the new world<br />
bow down, cause we're black metal punks<br />
we are the new lords, you'll follow our laws<br />
bow down, cause we're black metal punks
