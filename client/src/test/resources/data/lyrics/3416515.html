	Beyond reality, older than the universe<br />
It dwells in unknown places far from our mortal eyes<br />
Uneheard of for millennia, buy now it's time to rise<br />
With incantations of death, we summon thee, come forth<br />
Black goat<br />
Spewed forth from the darkest abyss of our minds<br />
A presence undivine with cloven hooves and blood filled roots<br />
The beginning and the end, the mother of all things to come<br />
With incantations of death, we summon thee, come forth<br />
Black goat<br />
Vast fields of rotting flesh, unearthly horrors twists your mind<br />
With incantations of death we summon thee, come forth<br />
Black goat<br />
Spewed forth from the darkest abyss of our minds<br />
A presence undivine with cloven hooves and blood filled roots<br />
The beginning and the end, the mother of all things to come<br />
With incantations of death, we summon thee, come forth<br />
Black goat<br />
Festering woods, that drink the putrid blood of earth<br />
Darkeness spreads the void to consume us all<br />
In the dark, we call her name, we thousand young<br />
With incantations of death, we summon thee, come forth<br />
Black goat
