	Tear yourself from me,<br />
I'll still be waiting here with sharp steel cuts covering my hands.<br />
My blood once ran warm.<br />
You burned me at the stake <br />
And left me dead upon the shores of broken dreams.<br />
You burned me long ago, <br />
and there's nothing left but memories now.<br />
That's when nerves go numb <br />
And spines turn into shards of glass.<br />
<br />
Algorithmic death, diastolic murder <br />
comes with every choking laugh and every glares.<br />
My intravenous death is all you left for me <br />
to bury with the broken picture frames.<br />
You burned me long ago, <br />
and thereâ€™s nothing left but memories now.<br />
That's when nerves go numb <br />
And spines turn into shards of glass.<br />
