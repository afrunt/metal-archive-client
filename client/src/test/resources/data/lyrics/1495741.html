	Like a disease, infesting every inch<br />
dig its claws, deeper within<br />
detoriating the very structures of man<br />
like rust, consuming all it can<br />
<br />
Pathetic ideals founded on trust<br />
the trust in your god that dont give a fuck<br />
you cling on to the lie of all lies<br />
I puke in your face and spit on your grave<br />
<br />
<br />
Like a plague, you're breeding like rats<br />
crawling and trampel as you struggle for air<br />
smothering eachother when you reach for the top<br />
your offspring, your old ones, crushed to dust<br />
<br />
You justify your actions with stories of old<br />
glorify the past and believe in the lies<br />
the lies constructed to decieve and disarm<br />
the only thing that comforts in your worthless existence<br />
<br />
<br />
A stinking vermin called mankind<br />
blood will be spilled by the knife in my hand<br />
blood for vanity<br />
blood for greed<br />
blood for all insanity<br />
<br />
Said to be the crown of creation<br />
just as deadly as the one made of thorns<br />
blindfolded by the blood in your eyes<br />
you fumble in darkness, and reach out for help<br />
<br />
Obsessed with actions of good or evil<br />
dividing yourself into better or worse<br />
you sickens me and are all equally pungent<br />
you will all rot in this world you have made<br />
<br />
<br />
Chanting:<br />
<br />
Inter faeces/excrementum et urinam nascimini<br />
Inter faeces/excrementum et urinam morimini
