	There is something weird behind your eyes<br />
Something I’ve never seen before<br />
Senseless and empty for mankind<br />
The eyes that won’t shine anymore<br />
<br />
This isn’t that we’d call a dream<br />
Same place, same time I’ve ever been<br />
Red wine on the wall…<br />
The fall shakes my chest and my soul<br />
<br />
Please, God, look at me<br />
I’m so terrorized<br />
Lend me your all-mighty hand<br />
<br />
Anything I try to do<br />
Turns into a burning breath<br />
Why me? Why now?<br />
Why you don’t?<br />
<br />
This rage will break my bloody chest<br />
Somewhere on earth!<br />
Does anybody feel my wrath?<br />
Somewhere on (Earth)<br />
<br />
There is something weird in me<br />
Whispering, drawing tears<br />
I think I’m gone<br />
I can reach the light and beyond<br />
<br />
Yeah, forced to get away<br />
So welcome to my runaway<br />
To my runaway<br />
<br />
Oh my Lord, I despise thou<br />
Will I ever reach your skies?<br />
“All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain”<br />
<br />
All those moments will turn in dust<br />
Out of conscience, beyond your mind<br />
<br />
Just behold their silent flight<br />
Thrown to distance, out of sight<br />
<br />
Dispossession, rape out of my wish<br />
Unearthly sight, skyline decrease<br />
<br />
If I could find someone out there<br />
As me so lost and desperate<br />
<br />
So lifetime circle… is complete<br />
<br />
Released, it seems the net caught me in the end<br />
The silver plankton floats among the darkest seas<br />
And the above term has just begun, the final sacrifice<br />
Coral of your mind still remains intact<br />
<br />
(Life)Do you feel my wrath?<br />
Somewhere out of this mad road?<br />
(See)Beyond this dawn<br />
Follow the stars, shiny shooting stars<br />
(Be)Enjoy your role<br />
Come close and look up your destiny<br />
(Go)Go forth<br />
Misplace the hate, will always consume your desires<br />
Put down your fingers, so reaper will be there<br />
Someday, for first time, you’ll be dead
