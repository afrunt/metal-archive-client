	At the first fall of snow,<br />
elder man sits with child in tow<br />
empty chair bathed in the firelight.<br />
<br />
He beckons his son,<br />
conveys to him this,<br />
story told to him by his father in twilight.<br />
<br />
The Gods will hold council<br />
Surtr will ride North from the flames of Muspellheim -<br />
the great serpent at his side!<br />
<br />
The earth will tremble at the pounding hooves of Surtr's horde!<br />
(The Einherjar will ready themselves!)<br />
<br />
As Bifrost crumbles - the mighty one will stand!<br />
With his sons and the dead army...<br />
<br />
They have prepared for ages -<br />
may their swords and spears find much giant flesh!<br />
Prepare the charge!<br />
<br />
The Gods will hold council<br />
Surtr will ride North from the flames of Muspellheim -<br />
the great serpent at his side!<br />
<br />
The earth will tremble at the pounding hooves of Surtr's horde!<br />
(The Einherjar will ready themselves!)
