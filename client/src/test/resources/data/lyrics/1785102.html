	Every time I come up for breath, You’re standing there pale and cold. I know this road far too well. And yes, I know, what lies beyond. So I’m dead to you now. Wash away the pain. Brought back to the lands, the grounds I hate. So I’m dead to you now. Wash away the shame. Brought back to the lands. With acquiescent frequencies. Who would’ve known that the song the dead man sings. Would call the light brigade to summon unto me a life where I was do to you forever. So I’m dead to you now. Wash away the pain. Brought back to the lands, the grounds I hate. So I’m dead to you now. Wash away the shame. Torn back to the lands
