	Going back to the point which it all began<br />
Thousand million times rain covered the barren earth<br />
<br />
This never ending voyage seems to make sense<br />
The forces of cosmos are capricious, they play with me<br />
<br />
Earth remains the same after all<br />
Nothing is what it used to be, though<br />
<br />
The creation of man turns insignificant<br />
Since we lost control of everything for so long<br />
<br />
So I’m standing here alone and cold<br />
My feelings once numbed they awake<br />
We all are linked to this concept<br />
We won’t scape from this great truth<br />
<br />
A taste of immortality will haunt you, will trap you<br />
But they’re just playing tricks on you<br />
<br />
It will take ages to understand<br />
That we’re just a product to be recycled<br />
There’s no peace, no eternal rest<br />
But millenniums and aeons to be covered<br />
<br />
Come here and gaze, try to look beyond the dawn<br />
There’s no choice but walking alone<br />
<br />
Born again!<br />
Die again!<br />
Face the end!<br />
Lay to rest!<br />
<br />
Take my hand!<br />
See the light!<br />
Come with me!<br />
Walk with me!
