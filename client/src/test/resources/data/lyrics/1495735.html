	See the sky, torn apart<br />
raining sulfur, burns the world<br />
engulfed in flames and waves<br />
just as said in the prophecy<br />
<br />
See the oceans rise like mountains<br />
casting shadows over the land<br />
towering up like giants in a warfield<br />
ready to strike their swords upon you<br />
<br />
See the ground crack wide open<br />
unleashing the great abyss<br />
the moans of a million voices<br />
speaking of the apocalypse<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When the beast spreads its wings<br />
and its tail shatters the ground<br />
look to the sky and see its blessings<br />
to end it all on this pitiful earth<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The stench of flesh, burnt to ashes<br />
cracks and peels like desert soil<br />
giant hooves that crushes the corpses<br />
killing all, young and old<br />
<br />
See the flames reach higher and higher<br />
til they burn the seraphs wings<br />
tumbling down in an neverending chant<br />
where they praise their fallen master<br />
<br />
Hear the thunder of the seven trumpets<br />
proclaiming the end of the world<br />
the sound, a dawning of a new era<br />
where youll all kneel to the dark one<br />
<br />
<br />
When the beast spreads its wings<br />
and its tail shatters the ground<br />
look to the sky and see its blessings<br />
to end it all on this pitiful earth<br />
<br />
A veil of darkness cloaks the universe<br />
ereasing all that the light had achieved<br />
like a fist, choking your world<br />
no time to repent or redeem<br />
<br />
12:3. And there was seen another sign in heaven. And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven diadems.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
When the beast spreads its wings<br />
and its tail shatters the ground<br />
look to the sky and see its blessings<br />
to end it all on this pitiful earth<br />
<br />
A veil of darkness cloaks the universe<br />
ereasing all that the light had achieved<br />
like a fist, choking your world<br />
no time to repent or redeem<br />
<br />
12:9 - And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world. And he was cast unto the earth: and his angels were thrown down with him.
