	Tear yourself from me, <br />
I'll still be waiting here with sharp steel cuts covering my hands. <br />
My blood once ran warm. <br />
You burned me at the stake and left me dead upon the shores of broken dreams. <br />
You burned me long ago, and there's nothing left but memories now. <br />
That's when nerves go numb and spines turn into shards of glass. <br />
Algorithmic death, diastolic murder comes with every choking laugh and every glares. <br />
My intravenous death is all you left for me to bury with the broken picture frames. <br />
You burned me long ago, and there1s nothing left but memories now. <br />
That's when nerves go numb and spines turn into shards of glass. <br />
