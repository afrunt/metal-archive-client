	Guns in the air, thunder spreads across the lands. Hooves bid for space on the blackest of sands. With reigns clenched in sweaty palms. He rides into the darkest mist. The Ancient Race of Men will fight tonight! Go. The Night is filled with promises. The Young Warrior rides through the nightscape. Forced to be the bringer of pain, It’s too late to call him back! She whispers in his ear. Fate is not what drew you here. You’re the only one. Who can keep this night alive. Cut these screams with anger! Back on the line explosions light the desert sky. The sun is slowly closing in. Gone is the boy who fought to save the sacred land tonight. Now his ghost will ride the road beyond. Go. The Night is filled with promises. The Young Warrior, a ghost of the nightscape. Forced to be the bringer of pain, it’s too late to call him back! She whispers in his ear. Fate is not what drew you here. You’re the only one. Who can keep this night alive. The Night is filled with promises. The Young Warrior, a ghost of the nightscape. Forced to be the bringer of pain, it’s too late to call him back! The Merciful create without a reason. Your agony! I’ve never been before. Down this way! Never.
