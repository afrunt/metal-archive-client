	As I sit upon my throne,<br />
my thoughts return to times of old,<br />
My land, my kin, I gave to sin –<br />
the gods of war have left my side<br />
Now I trust, my axe, my blade –<br />
which my own two hands have made<br />
The dragons gate lies up ahead,<br />
inside my chest the touch of dread<br />
<br />
Realize the truth that lies -<br />
Ravens eyes now speak through me<br />
Fate is sealed, my wounds not healed –<br />
the blackest days return to me<br />
<br />
A bitter taste, like dusks embrace –<br />
now fills my heart and soul with dread<br />
<br />
Chaos reigns as darkness falls<br />
The moonlight pale upon my brow,<br />
gusting wind a pale death shroud<br />
something tells me all has failed<br />
<br />
Entranced by their feline eyes,<br />
Swept farther into the skies<br />
Raven upon fates door,<br />
Speaks one word - NEVERMORE<br />
<br />
All that's left to take what's mine,<br />
No one left who can abide<br />
Turn and face the morning tide,<br />
Call wrathful gods down to my side<br />
<br />
Yet they know what hath transpired -<br />
Comes not one down unto me
