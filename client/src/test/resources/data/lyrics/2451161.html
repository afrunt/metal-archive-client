	Remembering the times <br />
When one stood proud. <br />
Alive in mind and spirit <br />
Knowing glory and his goals <br />
Once for himself - <br />
For all of them <br />
For what was his right - <br />
To be a man, to stand his ground. <br />
<br />
The edge of extinction <br />
Is their status quo <br />
There to win their battles <br />
To be the one man corps <br />
The last to keep their lines <br />
Celebrating their rights <br />
To be end of the line <br />
Not to die, to survive. <br />
<br />
Drink the blood of those in the way <br />
Savage them all <br />
The final right, give it away! <br />
Extinguish the flame, forever a slave! <br />
<br />
Raise war, rise again <br />
Thereâ€™s no peace, no rest from rage     <br />
<br />
Old world vanished <br />
Stands proud, when left in vanity <br />
Old world vanished <br />
Not stained. Recovering from insanity
