	Tears flying into the ancient solitude<br />
Cold air is the sign of my fear<br />
Torment and pain, secrecy of souls<br />
Misery and death under tears<br />
<br />
Serene sorrow, ddep in my heart<br />
Don't forget the dead's message:<br />
"Flowers for the dismal entombed"<br />
<br />
Candles burn and the life fall<br />
Please don't believe in your eyes<br />
<br />
Serene sorrow, deep in my heart
