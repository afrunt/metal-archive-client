	Confusion is here to stay; a cold sweat blinds my eyes<br />
Darkness devours my mind’s clarity<br />
Scepticism and questions, the answers remain hidden<br />
My steps don’t seem to make sense<br />
They move me away from reality<br />
Like a ghost with no sentence<br />
With no burden to be carried yet<br />
I prowl around this strange stage of suffocating surrealism.<br />
<br />
My senses own my body again<br />
The old scars and the memories burn so hard<br />
The afterlife is a proof of this tricky trap<br />
The afterlife is a proof of the oblivion’s lie<br />
<br />
Is this the consequence of a loathsome life?<br />
A proof, a punishment, a sentence<br />
Or a chance to rectify my deeds?<br />
<br />
My hands are shaking, they cover my eyes<br />
Fear devours my guts<br />
My conscience was never stained with blood<br />
¿So do I really deserve this?<br />
<br />
A barren paradise, it seems a point of no return<br />
My life has been taken to be in this place<br />
<br />
It’s time to begin the journey; it’s time to face the truth<br />
I must know the origin of this wretched fate of mine<br />
I drift away from all I love, from all I once won<br />
The weight of darkness make so hard to reach the shore<br />
One second feels like one billion years<br />
<br />
My senses own my body again<br />
The old scars and the memories burn so hard.<br />
The afterlife is a proof of the oblivion’s lie.<br />
<br />
Refuse it, deny it, avoid it<br />
Feed The Fire!<br />
It takes us, betray us, it fakes us<br />
Beat The Liar!
