	Along the mighty mountainsides<br />
Fog creeps beneath the tops<br />
A winding climb upon steep mountains<br />
To where the glacial tongue becomes my path<br />
<br />
Upon the mighty mountains heights<br />
These plateaus of my dreams<br />
I am at the greatest sight of all<br />
To where the glacial arms reach for me<br />
<br />
Highest mountains hear my call<br />
To you I'll guide myself<br />
The time has come for me to reach<br />
I'm brough too far to turn<br />
<br />
Tops that seem unreachable<br />
Tower in the sky<br />
Horizon to horizon<br />
On platforms yield with wind<br />
<br />
Mountains of ice calm in my sight<br />
Platforms built by wind<br />
Mountains of ice calm in my sight<br />
Platforms built for kings<br />
<br />
Along the mighty mountainsides<br />
Fog creeps beneath the tops<br />
A winding climb upon steep mountains<br />
To where the glacial tongue becomes my path<br />
<br />
Highest mountains hear my call<br />
To you I'll guide myself<br />
The time has come for me to reach<br />
I'm brough too far to turn
