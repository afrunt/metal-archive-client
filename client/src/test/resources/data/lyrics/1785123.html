	Watching you die on that October day. The trees turned to black, the skies turned to grey. They whispered from hell as your ghost left the room. The Year of Our Lord, the year you were consumed. I know you’re sleeping. You’re never coming home. The wolves are feeding. I know you’re not alone. You gave me my last name. Look at me, i see you looking back, when i close my eyes. Speak to me, i hear you talking back, when i sleep at night. Watching you die on that October day. The trees turned black, the skies turned to grey. The demons were slaughtered like lambs in the court of the saints. Watching you die on that October day. The trees turned to black, the skies turned to grey. They whispered from hell as your ghost left the room. The Year of Our Lord, the year you were consumed. Dead man’s son. I know you’re not alone. Dead man’s son. You gave me my last name. I know you’re sleeping. You’re never coming home. The wolves are feeding. I know you’re not alone. Look at me, i see you looking back, when i close my eyes. Speak to me, i hear you talking back, when i sleep at night. Look at me. Speak to me.
