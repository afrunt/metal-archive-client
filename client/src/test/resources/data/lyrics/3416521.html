	The world turns<br />
In a spiralling downfall<br />
Species succumb<br />
Mother undone<br />
Mankind will fail<br />
Getting rid of its plague<br />
Expand, fester degradation<br />
Civilization<br />
Will fall to its knees<br />
Grinding teeth to the ground<br />
Rising bile in its mouth<br />
Mountains erode<br />
Sandblasted birth<br />
The terminal impact<br />
Will shatter the earth<br />
When the heavens align<br />
Spawn the unholy cross<br />
Blackened fires will cleanse us<br />
Bereft human cause<br />
A terminal exhale<br />
Past burning millenia<br />
Merciless fire<br />
Will swallow us whole<br />
Merciless fire<br />
Ravenous flood<br />
Cascades of lava, a wretched dilation<br />
The end of mankind in a vast strangulation<br />
When the chimera shines through perpetual fear<br />
We shall all taste the fires of the end drawing near<br />
As sent from below <br />
Euthanasian mercy<br />
Calloused, cancerous<br />
Wretched life form<br />
Ominous glow<br />
From a near pending doom<br />
Dead plains, mass grave<br />
Slaughter of the slaves<br />
Mountains erode<br />
Sandblasted birth<br />
The terminal impact<br />
Will shatter the earth<br />
When the heavens align<br />
Spawn the unholy cross<br />
Blackened fires will cleanse us<br />
Bereft human cause<br />
Dead womb of a raped mother<br />
Grave for the billions of weak<br />
In the hollow left after<br />
Mankind has its peak
