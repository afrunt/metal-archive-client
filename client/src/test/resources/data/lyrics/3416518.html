	Cult of weakness, culture of lies<br />
These holy words spoken by hollow tongues<br />
You embrace oppression and fall to your knees<br />
You bow your head as a slave to their tyranny<br />
This is the bastion of hyopcrisy<br />
All praise<br />
Jesus saves<br />
The unnatural order of your god<br />
Carried out by sheep and guided by their herdsmen<br />
Propaganda echoes, raping the free will<br />
Fatigue their minds with lies upon lies<br />
Drink from the chalice of contempt<br />
Raise your head, stand strong and disobey<br />
Feel the fire<br />
Free the power of the beast<br />
All hailing the death of humanity<br />
The unnatural order of your god<br />
Carried out by sheep and guided by their herdsmen<br />
Propaganda echoes, raping the free will<br />
Fatigue their minds with lies upon lies
