	The wind fly round about the crypts<br />
The wait for the dawn of their souls<br />
When the light drive them to heaven<br />
Or darkness until the hells<br />
Torment in it's interrogatives<br />
Nailed in deep calvary<br />
Solitude and sorrow, misery and pain<br />
Image of a hope dream to meet<br />
<br />
The remembrance of a kiss, the magic of a flower.<br />
Images for the moment of solitude, moments of life<br />
That death consume
