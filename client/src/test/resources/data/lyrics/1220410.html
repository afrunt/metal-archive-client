	Nearing now to foreign soil<br />
we dress ourselves in battle clothes<br />
<br />
(Val-Father keep us)<br />
should we meet our bitter end<br />
Asa Thor, bless these blades<br />
may their thirst be quenched<br />
with the blood of my enemies<br />
<br />
before dawn our feet touch land<br />
the faintest sounds ring clearly in my ears<br />
<br />
100 throats unleash a fearsome cry<br />
we draw our swords<br />
and with Odin ride!<br />
For him, many will be slain<br />
the papal banner in blood stained!<br />
<br />
200 boots trample the ground beneath<br />
a garrison of the cross waits to meet us<br />
(blood gurgles from the throats of my victims)<br />
<br />
the first pair of eyes I see<br />
I put my axe in his face<br />
I roar in primal rage!<br />
I can feel the warmth of his blood<br />
spraying in my mouth!<br />
(we offer to Odin the gift of burning dead)<br />
<br />
100 throats unleash a fearsome cry<br />
we draw our swords<br />
and with Odin ride!<br />
For him, many will be slain<br />
the papal banner in blood stained!
