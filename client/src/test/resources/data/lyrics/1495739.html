	Cast out, pushed away <br />
banished to dwell in the deepest of holes <br />
Denied the love of his father and master <br />
forced to live of hatred and sorrow <br />
<br />
Said to be the deciever of worlds <br />
the one with his wings dipped in blood <br />
Feathers burnt of rage and rejection <br />
feel his victory in the crucifixtion <br />
<br />
Condemned to eternal damnation <br />
destined to rule over the blackest of souls <br />
Gathering minions of murderous disciples <br />
time to rise the wind of destruction <br />
<br />
Smell the blood of innocense and purity <br />
leading the dark horde into battle <br />
Leaving a dustcloud of agony and burning souls <br />
throw them scraps from their masters table <br />
<br />
<br />
There he sits, brooding on his throne of grief <br />
the dark lord, awaiting his revenge <br />
A war in heaven, started with the fall from grace <br />
the lord of light will die in satan's embrace <br />
<br />
<br />
Burning angels with lifeless eyes <br />
twisted bodies falling from the sky <br />
Broken limbs and scattered conviction <br />
trampeled faith and raving destruction <br />
<br />
On the run, left behind <br />
with no light, darkness prevails <br />
Devoured by legions of monstrous entities <br />
sadistic torment and grotesque cruelty <br />
<br />
<br />
There he sits, brooding on his throne of grief <br />
the dark lord, awaiting his revenge <br />
A war in heaven, started with the fall from grace <br />
the lord of light will die in satan's embrace <br />
<br />
Now the world is prepared <br />
to obey the forthcoming reign <br />
March in lines to the sound of mayhem <br />
praise the dark one with your life <br />
<br />
From the eternal sea,he rises <br />
creating armies on either shore <br />
Turning man against man <br />
til man exsists no more
