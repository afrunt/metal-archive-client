	Ashes came down like snow. From the city of rust and flames. Cut me free from the ledge where falcons prey. Lanterns sway back and forth. Phantom trees shed their leaves before me. Once again I ignite the storm within. Laughter. Bound by the rapture, splendor. The city is caving in. Cast her Into the winds of disaster. Faster. The candle’s burning thin. Blown! Out of the sky tonight. When the Nightlark sees the moonlight, he will spread his wings and sing. Gone. Is the city of sinking time young man. I set you free. With a full heart I release thee. Bastard. Master. Faster. One year from today I’ll cut you free from here. Bow for creation. Suffer unto me. I place upon you the curse of daylight. Once again I’m stripping flesh from bone. Ashes falling down like snow. From the city of rust and flames. Forever chained to the ledge where falcons prey. Laughter. Bound by the rapture. Splendor. The city is caving in. Cast her into the winds of disaster. Faster. The candle’s burning thin.
