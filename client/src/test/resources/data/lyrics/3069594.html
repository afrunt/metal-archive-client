	Last night I had a vivid dream, <br />
 I found a place where nothing’s what it seems, <br />
 I’m bound to walk this earth alone, <br />
 I am a hunter and the heir to the throne, <br />
<br />
 The chase of blood and sweet revenge, <br />
 It keeps on hammering in my head, <br />
 The urge to kill is getting stronger, <br />
 I’m south of heaven, north of hell, <br />
 My final place to rest, <br />
<br />
 Surrender your soul, <br />
 Surrender your pride, <br />
 Please enter my dream, <br />
 Find your natural high, <br />
 You’ve got nothing to fear, <br />
 Cause your rebirth is near, <br />
<br />
 The battle rages deep inside, <br />
 No where to run for my eternal bride, <br />
 And when the darkness comes around, <br />
 I come alive cause, glorious we, by blood I am bound, <br />
<br />
 I taste your blood so bitter sweet, <br />
 Come ease my pain get on your knees, <br />
 You know throughout is meant to be, <br />
 Forever missed out what it seems, <br />
 This is your final scream, <br />
<br />
 Surrender your soul, <br />
 Surrender your pride, <br />
 Please enter my dream, <br />
 Find your natural high, <br />
 You’ve got nothing to fear, <br />
 Cause your rebirth is near, <br />
<br />
 So you are born again, <br />
 To a higher plane, <br />
 In my dark lair you’re part of the game, <br />
 Forever we are, forever we’ll be, <br />
 We’re forever free, <br />
<br />

 [Solo: Oscar] <br />
<br />
 Surrender your soul, <br />
 Surrender your pride, <br />
 Please enter my dream, <br />
 Find your natural high, <br />
 You’ve got nothing to fear, <br />
 Cause your rebirth is near
