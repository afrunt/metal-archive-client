	I can’t remember the reason why I’m here<br />
Will sworn of demons, release their capture of the day?<br />
Incoming lost souls, swallowed by hell’s gear<br />
Unleash the cry, ‘cause your terror will be mine!<br />
<br />
All dark stories, are carved on these lands<br />
Little hope feelings<br />
For long misplaced, disappeared<br />
Pain overloaded, so bad moments back to me<br />
Eyebrows wide open<br />
When horror takes its place<br />
Right now<br />
<br />
Why mankind deserve salvation?<br />
Compassionate… not Universe best point<br />
Eternity… for first time, lacking of knowledge<br />
Let their believe the braves are saved<br />
<br />
It is unfair, be judged, down here, without a voice<br />
Can’t defense my spirit, from the bondage? from the burn?<br />
<br />
Unbelievable<br />
All the fingers pointing to me<br />
The crowd is shouting<br />
That alien voices are crushing in my head!<br />
<br />
"I am guilty for living<br />
Guilty for being real...”<br />
Don’t despise that affliction<br />
Don’t waste that pain!<br />
You should not misspend the horror<br />
Of billions souls ago<br />
Below your feet<br />
<br />
“Oh no, no tears, please… it is a waste of good suffering”<br />
<br />
Deep in Hell’s core, boiling minds<br />
Feel the sorrow left behind<br />
<br />
So dreadful, so dire<br />
“Now look for freedom up to sky, up high”
