	The Daywalker brings the filth. She turns around in fear of what the shadows shout. She stares into his eyes. In foul tongue he casts the violence. Praying for an end. His bitter poison kills the youth left inside. His grip is growing tight. To this wicked game she’s lost the will to fight. Cast these screams away. Save me. Her world is going black. He plants his demon seed. Save me. Her world is going black. child of Sin. What I’d give to feel the same again. To walk with the living again. What I’d give to walk with the young again. Child of Sin. What I’d give to feel th same again. To walk with the living again. I know this is not your fault. This disease has made me what I’m not. A mother to the child of sin. I resent you child, now go away. Go, right now. Leave, right now. Rotting. Aging old and gray. Wasted. I turn my back on you. Aging old and gray. Child. I turn my back on you
