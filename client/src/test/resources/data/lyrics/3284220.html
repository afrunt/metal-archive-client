	Once emerged - the stillness<br />
Leaving no prospect for a new dawn<br />
<br />
There is no time, there is no new dawn<br />
Being effortless in vain will serve no goal<br />
Unleash life - walk the path of the dead<br />
What is there to discover will speak for itself<br />
<br />
There is no time, there is no dawn<br />
<br />
And now I am on the way<br />
to the last of the shores<br />
The fading light sets a blaze<br />
into the forest of souls<br />
<br />
Endless night has embraced thy soul<br />
Enlightenment in coal-black<br />
There is no return...<br />
<br />
There is no time, there is no new dawn<br />
Being effortless in vain will serve no goal<br />
Unleash life - walk the path of the dead<br />
What is there to discover will speak for itself<br />
<br />
There is no time, there is no dawn<br />
Being effortless in vain will serve no goal<br />
There is no time, there is no return
