	It's a great day for fire<br />
It's a great day for wrath<br />
It's a warrior's desire<br />
Ride down the mountainside<br />
<br />
Blinding days on the desert<br />
Blinding sun in my eyes<br />
Mighty cities before us<br />
Ride with your heads held high<br />
<br />
Hungry hordes rode the sands<br />
Into the open fire<br />
I ride through savage lands<br />
For victory and desire<br />
<br />
Steel glimpse - waving spears<br />
This hunger's constantly<br />
Passing through the endless world<br />
Where great warriors sleep<br />
<br />
From the mountainous regions<br />
Awakens the day<br />
Shining armours and horses<br />
Head to the battleflields<br />
It's a great day for fire<br />
It's a great day for wrath<br />
A man's fate is his own<br />
The world's at an end
