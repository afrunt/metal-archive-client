	Everything's a lie <br />
Everything you hear, everything you see <br />
So much to spew it out <br />
(Evil) Where is it come from? <br />
<br />
The only thing to do <br />
Make an island with your truth <br />
<br />
Wrong. I've seen another world. <br />
Things you never will <br />
<br />
In this world, a man himself is nothing <br />
And there's just this world. <br />
Just this rock <br />
<br />
Do you ever feel lonely? <br />
Only around people
