	Death Beyond Flag or Uniform <br />
<br />
Dig in! Hold your ground!<br />
Keep your head calm and stay down!<br />
Defend then push them back, grind them down with our attack<br />
pull your trigger, watch them die, frozen bodies grasps for life <br />
<br />
Rain your bullets! Show them hell!<br />
Make them drown in trenches of decay!<br />
Run him over, crush his head, beat his body til he's dead<br />
clench your jaw and clear your mind, either one of you must die<br />
<br />
<br />
This is war - survival of the fittest<br />
death beyond flag or uniform<br />
This is war - it's you or them<br />
life in its nakedness<br />
<br />
Reinforce! Watch your flanks!<br />
Squash them dead with the power of our tanks!<br />
Scattered brains and crunching bones, hear a wind of silent moans<br />
trampeled faces, dying eyes, reek of death is in the air<br />
<br />
You must hunt! Kill your prey!<br />
If you do not, you'll be slain!<br />
Build up your rage and let it fly, feel it growing deep inside<br />
unleash the savage on your foe, the blood is steaming in the snow<br />
<br />
<br />
This is war - survival of the fittest<br />
death beyond flag or uniform<br />
This is war - it's you or them<br />
life in its nakedness<br />
<br />
<br />
Supremacy! Divinity!<br />
The enemy shall lick our feet!<br />
Burning wreckage, deep in dust, blazed in fire and bloodlust<br />
turn the tides and win the battle, hunt them down like fleeing cattle<br />
<br />
No remorse! Just obey!<br />
You must do all they say!<br />
Feel the power flowing through you, life and death is nothing to you<br />
humans has a violent story, carved in flesh by death and glory
