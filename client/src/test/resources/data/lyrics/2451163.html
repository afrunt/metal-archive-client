	It is not lack of faith, but the dark within <br />
For they are the cold, dark matter paradise <br />
<br />
Depraved palace of men, under the guidance of hell <br />
Cold as glory and death. A final place of rest? <br />
A dark matter universe - Clusters on a path of doom <br />
One last burst of hate, a menace set on its' way <br />
<br />
...and the only way to defend themselves <br />
is to release the beast within. <br />
Those that shatter the illusion, <br />
that one can hide his rage. <br />
<br />
Transparent paragons of death - <br />
cold dark matter paradise <br />
<br />
It is not lack of faith, but the dark within <br />
For that they are the cold, dark matter paradise <br />
Transparent paragons of death - cold dark matter paradise <br />
Depraved palace of men, under guidance of hell <br />
<br />
â€¦and the only way to defeat themselves <br />
is to release the beast within. <br />
Those that shatter the illusion, <br />
that one can hide his rage.
