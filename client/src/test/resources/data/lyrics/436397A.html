	The cave of my journey is anathema of my dawn<br />
The devil want my soul in the eve of my death<br />
Echoes in the way to uknown,<br />
Poetry of the innocence's flight is born.<br />
Choirs of damnation and choirs of redemption<br />
I can hear.<br />
<br />
The cross in my hand is the symbol of my fear<br />
I feel a inner desolate void in the path to misteries<br />
In the river Stix Charon and his boat,<br />
In the edge of light of fate in my inner huble soul.<br />
<br />
Hipocrisy is the new false messiah.<br />
Maitreya, daughter of Satan's desire.<br />
Thi is new age, new age of aquarius.<br />
The reign of perdition<br />
Is time to tribulation !
