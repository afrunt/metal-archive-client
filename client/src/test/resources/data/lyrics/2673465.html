	You'll take my life but I'll take yours too<br />
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through<br />
So when you're waiting for the next attack<br />
You'd better stand, there's no turning back<br />
The bugle sounds and the charge begins<br />
But on this battlefield no one wins<br />
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath<br />
As I plunge on into certain death<br />
<br />
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run<br />
The mighty roar of the Russian guns<br />
And as we race toward the human wall<br />
The screams of pain as my comrades fall<br />
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground<br />
And the Russians fire another round<br />
We get so near yet so far away<br />
We won't live to fight another day<br />
<br />
We get so close near enough to fight<br />
When a Russian gets me in his sights<br />
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow<br />
A burst of rounds take my horse below<br />
And as I lay there gazing at the sky<br />
My body's numb and my throat is dry<br />
And as I lay forgotten and alone<br />
Without a tear I draw my parting groan
