	Sweat rolls from the edge of my pale brow. Magnificent orbifolds run rampant in my head. Complex octanes trace my cerebral nodes. My world in nothing more than a deep translucent hum. Now gravity wears thin. My pulse begins to slow. The infernal hunt goes on. I hold cold metal to my head. The taste of lust kicks in. The infernal hunt goes on. Pleasure spiked with pain. Animal nitrate. Pleasure spiked with pain. Animal nitrate. Watch me, Taste me, Crave me, Enslave me. I hold cold metal to my head. The taste of lust kicks in. The infernal hunt goes on. Watch me, Taste me, Crave me, Enslave me. Now gravity wears thing. My pulse begins to slow. The infernal hunt goes on. I hold cold metal to my head. The taste of lust kicks in. The infernal hunt goes on.
