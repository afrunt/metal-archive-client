	Marching through the gates of fire<br />
New battles on the rise<br />
Breathing in the winds of war<br />
Victorious desire deep inside<br />
<br />
Tyrants' wrath upon this world<br />
Bestow the might to throne<br />
Battalions on the fields of war<br />
To chaos we are bound<br />
<br />
Nameless cities left behind<br />
High fires in the air<br />
Fear us those whose time has come<br />
Awaiting in despair<br />
<br />
Fury swings its blackened blades<br />
From the sky a fire rain<br />
Darkness marches on this night<br />
On pride we fight<br />
<br />
With the dying sun we ride<br />
Into the honored age<br />
Searching for the golden past<br />
Bounded deep with rage<br />
<br />
Magic moments magic times<br />
Barbarians born to stride<br />
Ride with splendor for the war<br />
Battalions at our side<br />
<br />
Fury swings its blackened blades<br />
From the sky a fire rain<br />
Darkness marches on this night<br />
On pride we fight<br />
<br />
Stories tel of fallen men<br />
Great voctories and fights<br />
And all that rode towards te fields<br />
To conquer thrones and might<br />
<br />
Legends brought forward to tell<br />
Tempting from another time<br />
Devoted to the victories<br />
They batlled for themselves<br />
<br />
Battalions<br />
Battalions
