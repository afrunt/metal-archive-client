	The whole chance for conscious life,<br />
sacrificed to denial of awakening of mind<br />
Obedience over one's true self,<br />
a mental state ignoring the recognition of what is<br />
<br />
Death is what you have awaited<br />
for the whole self-approved eternity<br />
Aware of it but turning away,<br />
into the darkness to dwell<br />
<br />
No life to bother, no life to turn away from?<br />
You are not to suffer, unless if threatening the form?<br />
<br />
Like an icon of sacramental penance<br />
A devoted sinner seeking for absolution<br />
Once a candidate for prosperous life -<br />
Enter death and humiliation!<br />
<br />
Unreveal yourself - there is no life to bother!<br />
Unreveal yourself - there is no life to bother!<br />
<br />
The unclear state of last awareness of yourself<br />
Idle efforts to sum the essence of the moments passing by<br />
<br />
I will come back and make it worthwhile, you say<br />
With death on your face - an image of incredulous remorse<br />
<br />
If there was ever any will or doubt,<br />
that was when you had no life to bother about<br />
There was none other to savage your body and mind<br />
All of your existence in exchange to an anxious state of fright<br />
Not sure if you should have looked if this was a fallacy for life<br />
What would have been the reason to follow man's self earned right?<br />
<br />
Like an icon of sacramental penance<br />
A devoted sinner seeking for absolution<br />
Once a candidate for prosperous life -<br />
Enter death and humiliation!<br />
<br />
Unreveal yourself - there is no life to bother!<br />
Unreveal yourself - there is no life to bother!
