	Past nightmares chasing your soul!<br />
<br />
Heated by those burning flames<br />
Which are feed with suffering<br />
I escape from the shrieking demons<br />
They try to snatch my mind away<br />
<br />
Gasping for breath, I run away<br />
I mock the pursuit of my death<br />
It’s illusory, but his claws<br />
Feel so real that makes me shudder<br />
<br />
Blaze a trail in time<br />
Hide to this threat, reach out for the light<br />
Tear down barriers<br />
And cross every dimensional gate<br />
<br />
Once I get rid of the horror<br />
And cries from the past have ceased<br />
I get into a new perception<br />
A new universal truth<br />
<br />
Time consists on thousands particles<br />
So different from each other<br />
Can see no end for this number<br />
Just colours, shapes and amazement<br />
<br />
Men, they have always feared the things that dwell inside<br />
The suffocating dark<br />
I’m about to reveal the secrets that remain<br />
In those obscure affairs<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Defy this mystic challenge<br />
And leave your tread in every world you reach<br />
Leave your fears behind<br />
Because you control every step you make<br />
<br />
When your black eyes are too blind to see<br />
And the gravity forces you to grovel<br />
Clench your fists in anger, get rise to your feet<br />
And rage against the oppressive force<br />
Make universe tremble!<br />
<br />
For you there is no redemption<br />
Consequence of your deceptions<br />
Won’t escape from this damnation<br />
Free way to mind domination<br />
<br />
So grit your teeth in pain<br />
Your efforts are in vain<br />
Don’t go against the grain<br />
Your loss is our gain!<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
Defy this mystic challenge<br />
And make a stand against the cosmic will<br />
Leave your fears behind<br />
Trust your decisions, they will take you away
