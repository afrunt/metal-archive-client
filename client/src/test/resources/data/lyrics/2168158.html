	This time the devil dealt a bad hand<br />
walk away or your soon to be a dead man<br />
walk away don’t hesitate <br />
 <br />
Just play one more time your life will be over <br />
with every passing breath that could be your last one<br />
you’ll never pay the price of toll to cross  over<br />
with death’s hands gripped right around your cold heart<br />
 <br />
You play with fate like life is made of second chances<br />
you always play for all or nothing<br />
 <br />
You’ll lose one day because everyone has got to lose sometime<br />
you’ll lose one day get fucked by lady luck fucked<br />
 <br />
You can not cheat your way through life when it’s over<br />
go on and cross the line it will be your time<br />
you wont redeem yourself in time to cross over<br />
with deaths eyes fix firmly o n your last breath<br />
 <br />
Sinners game.
