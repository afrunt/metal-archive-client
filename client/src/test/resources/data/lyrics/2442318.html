	Time to say farewell to this world.<br />
<br />
Even if it was "The Black Shield"...<br />
There is the shield in order to protect everyone<br />
<br />
All vampire's sin are my sin. Because the cause is in me.<br />
I must atone for past Deeds. That is, it indicates the Death.<br />
<br />
My blood wasn't able to be exterminated by sunlight.<br />
all was mistake and meaningless<br />
<br />
This blood, lineage should perish and never awake.<br />
Up to the last drop of the blood.<br />
<br />
However I was feeling sadness always<br />
Because we are the vampires which are always hungry<br />
for blood, and have to continue living in the Dark<br />
As Dust return to Dust, I will also return to ashes<br />
<br />
Loneliness and pain made the Desire amplify<br />
and malice became mighty nightly<br />
<br />
I wish to liberate you from "Blood Oath"<br />
Please understand this feeling of mine<br />
<br />
さあ　おいで　夜の子供達<br />
眠れ　永遠の孤独を招くなかれ<br />
<br />
愛されずに生まれ来る魂は誰一人いない<br />
在るべき姿へ還ろう　神の御名を呼び求めて<br />
<br />
終わりなき闇に大いなる光あれ　天より<br />
<br />
しかと見た　心の目で　探し求めた姿<br />
憐れみの時間を与える　神の御心は答えて<br />
偉大なる愛は深く　彷徨える者でさえ<br />
変えられぬ未来などない　神の御前にて誓って<br />
<br />
やがて罪の死は訪れ　苦しみは去り　今は眠りへ…<br />
<br />
If God give me hug gently some day<br />
I will know true meaning of the eternity<br />
<br />
There're few people who can find out the narrow gate to the paradise<br />
but I wish to meet you again<br />
<br />
If I can live with you on God's side, it's very wonderful<br />
Only God saves us
