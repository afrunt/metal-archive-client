	Dead, I lean over you, gaze at your body in all its rigor mortis glory<br />
touch, my fingers run from your neck to your gut, caressing and feeling, a tingling sensation<br />
my face so near, I put my ear to your chest, I close my eyes and listen to the silence<br />
inhale your scent, intoxication at its finest, I lick my lips and dream away<br />
<br />
<br />
Stale cold precense boils my blood<br />
you lie still but I see our shadows on the wall, <br />
entwined in morbid love, swaying to the dance of death<br />
hold my hand and I will lead you to our thrones, bow down your head to be crowned by me<br />
a crown of light to shine in your dead life, to carry you over the mortals stream<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are my princess, sculpted in dead flesh, a mannequin under my command<br />
I am your king and you are my slave, obey my wishes til the world withers old<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your body is my temple, a temple of flesh, sacrifice yourself to me, your god<br />
quench my urge, my need, my hunger, my lust, my dreams, embrace me and fill me with your lifeless entity<br />
like a touch divine, you heal my shattered soul, drown me in a reeking serenity<br />
join me now for a fetid night in the decaying halls of our putrid ballroom<br />
<br />
Our feast of macabre, our feast of stench, joining us in unholy matrimony<br />
chained by forbidden love through eternity<br />
<br />
But when the night is over and I've claimed your flesh<br />
an empty void fills my heart, sad I leave you to rot in my bed, in search of a new queen to rule by my side
