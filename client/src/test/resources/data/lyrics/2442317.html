	Several Decades have passed after that Day<br />
The time of accomplishing resurrection came just now<br />
<br />
Am I sleeping?<br />
Am I awake? God...<br />
<br />
I'm the king of the vampire that was born from the Darkness<br />
<br />
The eyes and a lip seem to be roses and the skin looks white like snow<br />
I'm not allowed to Die, and continued sleeping for a long time<br />
I have to Do the last Duty as a king of the vampire<br />
<br />
I Decided to remove the roots of vampire's blood this evening<br />
<br />
I'm nothingness<br />
This feeling will not be fulfilled eternally<br />
<br />
Do you hate me?<br />
You will surely hate me.<br />
But I hate myself more than whom<br />
I want to apologize to God and them from the bottom of my heart.<br />
<br />
I will welcome the night of our last<br />
The Sun sinks and night of the Darkness begins to spread the world<br />
I will Disappear having held recollections with her in a breast.<br />
<br />
She made me remember the importance of love<br />
However, nobody can change this fact<br />
<br />
I'm the king of the vampire that was born from the Darkness<br />
<br />
Am I still alive?<br />
Am I already Dead? God....
