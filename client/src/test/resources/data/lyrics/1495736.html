	You believe there are those who love you, those who really wish you well<br />
but he knows they despise you, that they laugh and spit at your filthy name<br />
you think they praise you and worship you like their own god<br />
but as you dream and sleep, they move in to slit your throat<br />
<br />
Punishing the innocent, they scream<br />
random acts of violence, they bleed<br />
torture and suffering, but why?<br />
unaware and obediant, his slave<br />
<br />
His servant, at his command<br />
he uses you, like a pawn in his game<br />
<br />
Paranoid delusions, like fever boiling in your blood<br />
greedy eyes that pierce, they carve like knives in your head <br />
like a worm you crawl on the floor, once the master - now the slave<br />
he is pulling the strings, he is the one who made you fall<br />
<br />
<br />
His servant, at his command<br />
he uses you, like a pawn in his game<br />
you're nothing, just one of his tools<br />
for the final solution, extinction of man
