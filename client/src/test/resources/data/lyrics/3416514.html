	Cities, laid to ruins embraced in dust<br />
Its buldings, like broken fingers pointing to the stars<br />
Skies, where wretched vultures fly at night<br />
Rivers, crimson red by all the lives<br />
A sacrifice, hand me his life<br />
Spill the blood, let it be soaked up by the ground<br />
Give me praise, kneel in the mud<br />
Cry out my name and victory will be thine<br />
I am death, bringer of the end<br />
You have served my cause well<br />
As old as time, all things die by my hand<br />
This is the end, hear the death knell <br />
Skulls, shattered under the weight of steel<br />
Like iron teeths, leaving it's scars on the soil<br />
Endless graves vast fields of death<br />
Remnants of warriors whose souls will never be free<br />
A sacrifice, hand me your life<br />
Spill the blood and let it be soaked up by the ground<br />
Shackled to the stone of defeat<br />
Dishonoured throughout eternity<br />
I am death, bringer of the end <br />
You have served my cause well<br />
As old as time, all things die by my hand<br />
This is the end, hear the death knell<br />
I am death, in my hourglass runs sand<br />
You died as the grains fell<br />
Time stands still in this barren land<br />
This is the end, welcome to hell
