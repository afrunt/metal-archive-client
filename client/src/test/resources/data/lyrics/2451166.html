	Maybe better not to remember? <br />
Maybe better not to have been told? <br />
Yet all is alive – <br />
Only wolves are now wandering blind. <br />
<br />
The end of an ancient world. <br />
Tales of  deeds carolled in blood <br />
Land of the forgotten sons  – <br />
Kings and nations forgone. <br />
<br />
Land of giants – one of them is fire <br />
His brothers – the wind we breathe <br />
The body of water – so generous and deep <br />
We are all heirs of the ground we keep. <br />
<br />
The three crowns returned to the west <br />
To reminisce where the third had rest <br />
Hill forts abandoned by the guests <br />
Too steep the slopes for the two bears <br />
to make their nests. <br />
<br />
Land of giants – one of them is fire <br />
His brothers – the wind we breathe <br />
The body of water – so generous and deep <br />
We are all heirs of the ground we keep. <br />
<br />
Of wood, stone and bone his castles are made <br />
His folk gathered in the backwoods' maze <br />
Fortified with twigs, ice and horns <br />
Stone cold souls awaiting the battle that will not be lost. <br />
<br />
Maybe better not to remember? <br />
Maybe better not to have been told? <br />
Yet all is alive – <br />
Only wolves are blind.
