	Emerged from the shadows<br />
Reincarnated by the walls<br />
Into the blackened meadows<br />
Straight into the darkside falls<br />
All souls on fire<br />
Coloured by a bloodred sky<br />
The flames reaching higher<br />
Feel the glimpse of red tonight<br />
<br />
The curse of men<br />
Has become our fate<br />
It brought us here<br />
To end our days<br />
Countdown for the walls of time<br />
The age of light will pass away<br />
<br />
The storm race against us<br />
A thousands days of misery<br />
All fall in twilight<br />
Burning for eternity<br />
Oh what an age to reign<br />
Blasting flames in the sky<br />
Waiting for that moment<br />
Journey to the other side<br />
<br />
The curse of men<br />
Has become our fate<br />
It brought us here<br />
To end our days<br />
Countdown for the walls of time<br />
The age of light will pass away<br />
<br />
There's no essence,no future<br />
You wouldn't know what I have seen<br />
There's no essence,no future<br />
Cursed we are - eternally<br />
<br />
Fly souls of hatred<br />
Spread your wings across the sky<br />
To the end of the earth<br />
Riding at the speed of light<br />
All end in damage<br />
Mindless voices call your name<br />
Devoted to the darkness<br />
Driven by the force that reigns<br />
<br />
Cursed we are to die as men<br />
Beneath the gods of ice and sand<br />
Cursed we are - all<br />
The earth man and sky shall fall<br />
<br />
There's no essence,no future<br />
You wouldn't know what I have seen<br />
There's no essence,no future<br />
Cursed we are - eternally
