	You left me for dead. And Iâ€™m the one who brought you here. Running from my truth too plain. No one hears natures cry. The skies above. Dim earth below. Lark in the wind. Call out this fatal flaw. Nightlark. Who is your master. Nightspark. Winds die my fire. Nightlark. Can you see me. Nightlark. Licking mans wounds. Lark you seem to know. The skies above. Dim earth below. Lark in the wind. Lark you seem to know. Lark you seem to know.
