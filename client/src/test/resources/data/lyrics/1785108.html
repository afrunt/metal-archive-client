	Follow me in! I did not live until you bled out of me. But we pushed on and on. You do not know what it’s like being in here. To the Gones of Astria. They have all forgotten you by now. One less mouth to fill. And their world is fading away. They have all forgiven you by now. Taking from their empty hands. When you knew they had nothing to give anymore. Follow me in! I did not live until you bled out of me. But we phsued on and on. You do not know what it’s like being in here. To the Gones of Astria. How far have you fallen by now. Look down. it’s a long way to go all alone. They have probably finished you by now. Now you see that forever is a long way to go all alone. Follow me in. I did not live until you bled out of me. But we pushed on and on. You do not know what it’s like being in here. To the Gones of Astria. Racing down the open road. To the Gones of Astria. One more kill. Racing down the open road. To the Gones of Astria.
