	It’s time for the serpent to die. I repent. I regret. Did he cry. It’s time for this leaders demise. Oh what pin in his name did we drive. Snakes that twist In rotting mouths. Grafted media sensation. Of the same fucking temptations. We’ve not the days to raise the weak at will. Dense carcass seas in a land of faming atrocity. No need for prophets when even the priest pakcs heat. Now turn short hours and I wonder whos god might know. Serpentine Medea. We’ve not the days to raise the weak at will. Lust and fear rest before you. Die. Never fear the blast of the pouring rain. It’s so real. The lust before you. Serpentine Medea. We’ve not the days to raise the weak at will. Lust and fear rest before you. Die. Never fear the blast of the pouring rain. It’s so real. The lust before you. Serpentine Medea. We’ve got to taste the weak at will. Lust and fear rest before me. The dense carcass seas are never real. Never fear the blast of the pouring rain. It’s so real. The lust before you. Snakes that twist in rotting mouths. Grafted media sensation. Of the same fucking temptations. Serpentine spine. Wasting away. Rest as you wait for me. Lust and sin. Wasting away. Learn the fear rotting. Serpentine’s Spine. Medea’s Spine. It’s our timeline. It’s our lifeline.
