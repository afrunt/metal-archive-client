	Only through the end of times sight<br />
We can get back and start again, and again<br />
When the end shows another path<br />
And the Ferryman points the way forward<br />
“Should I run and never look back..?”<br />
<br />
From death to live, and live to know<br />
I’m here again<br />
<br />
To see to hear, and hear to learn<br />
And learn to tell<br />
<br />
We give them more than we can give<br />
Until decease<br />
Stagnate as flesh in a cloudy fate<br />
I breathe away<br />
<br />
Crawling, dreaming<br />
Waiting to rise<br />
Shouting, crying<br />
Feeling the cold<br />
<br />
So here I am, I’m a part of all again<br />
Plummeting incredibly across the clouds and air<br />
<br />
That “wisdom spark”<br />
Soon gone and lost in time<br />
Crush my conscience and stuns my new senses<br />
<br />
Hundreds of thousands of years have passed<br />
From the rise of the immortals<br />
To the vast painful ground<br />
<br />
Some kind of deathless<br />
Stronger thing I’m supposed to be<br />
Through incalculable myriads of millenniums I’m back<br />
<br />
I feel the heart beats of all the living beings<br />
Along the entire world, them all…<br />
<br />
Somewhere here<br />
You’ll be back<br />
Where you will land?<br />
No one knows<br />
<br />
Before the darkness growl<br />
(When the master takes control)<br />
The stars are there to tell<br />
(Blasting stars along the ride)<br />
Ten billion years ago<br />
(You were the origin)<br />
My soul resides somewhere…<br />
(Somewhere here on the Earth)
