	An abomination of filth, a squirming pit of beasts<br />
Entangled in blood and shit, drowning in rage, fear and dismay<br />
A pulsating crown of death famine, plague and war<br />
A monument over this world's death and their dying virgin whore<br />
They have been lurking in the underworld, thriving on your lies<br />
A black mass of agony and their plague to be born<br />
Like a tower of vermin reaching for our surface<br />
A womb bound to burst open and spew its offspring out in the world<br />
A black river, like a vortex of pulsating flesh<br />
You'll be drowning in a sea of horror<br />
Dragged down to the bowels of hell<br />
This is what it has led to<br />
This is what you deserve<br />
Pestilence that crawls from underneath<br />
And drags you down in the earth<br />
The final hour is here, the end of all to come<br />
Your blood will flow as sacrifice<br />
And rats will fill your lungs and throats<br />
Forgotten by the universe, forgotten through all time<br />
Banished to the rotten soil, this will be your ultimate doom<br />
A black river, like a vortex of pulsating flesh<br />
You'll be drowning in a sea of horror<br />
Dragged down to the bowels of hell<br />
Neverending torment<br />
Abysmal suffering choking on your ignorance, suffocated by the beasts
