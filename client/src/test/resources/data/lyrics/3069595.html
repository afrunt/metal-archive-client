	I ride a wind of no return<br />
My soul is cold my mind burns<br />
I ride my fate with all my hate<br />
This is my search this is my state<br />
<br />
I ride a storm of no reverse<br />
My spirit's dark this is my curse<br />
I journey fast this time won't last<br />
My fate is sealed there's no reveal<br />
<br />
The storm I ride,again and again<br />
A soul on ice<br />
The storm I ride until the end<br />
<br />
I ride a war that's on my own<br />
My will is strong I bow to none<br />
I am my fate I breathe my hate<br />
Into your soul you're in the cold<br />
<br />
The storm I ride,again and again<br />
A soul on ice<br />
The storm I ride until the end
