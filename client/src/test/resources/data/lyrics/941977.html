	On days of north wind infinity appears<br />
Against the unknown allegiance of fear<br />
Of pagan wisdoms and pagan sights<br />
We created kingdoms blended by might<br />
<br />
All fearless servants<br />
Blind fortunes for the throne<br />
For the ode of glory dominated here<br />
<br />
On glorious horses through wide landscapes<br />
Might poisoned the minds of men<br />
From the age of passion<br />
Soldiers of the hand<br />
Under the wrath of the sun<br />
They ruled the lingdoms<br />
And built a new dawn<br />
<br />
Dark kings hailed beyond all fate<br />
Above the gates of infinity<br />
Imperiums call the profane<br />
<br />
On days of north wind illusions appear<br />
Against the unknown allegiance of fear<br />
Pagan wisdom - pagan sights<br />
Create the vision blended by might<br />
<br />
Dark empries beyond all fate<br />
Above the gates of infinty<br />
Imperiums call the profane
