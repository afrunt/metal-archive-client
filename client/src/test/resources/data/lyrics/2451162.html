	For lichens to feast, for winds to breath <br />
For rains to dissolve me on bitter stones <br />
No earth corrupted, the unclean immolated <br />
Haven for the seeker of silence <br />
<br />
Below - the sacred groves, <br />
spring water and cup stones <br />
Sky burial and the last ritual <br />
of the one who no longer exists <br />
<br />
The earth that you walked - you are. <br />
Occurring in this liquid of life - that you once drunk. <br />
<br />
Your essence embellished by moon <br />
Your timelessness surrounded in doom <br />
Our inane questions before you <br />
No light will turn us away from gloom <br />
<br />
The earth that you walked - you are. <br />
Occurring in this liquid of life - that you once drunk. <br />
A universe to some and a void to the rest <br />
Bow before those who leave a mark to respect
