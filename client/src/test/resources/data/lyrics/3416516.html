	Darkness falls<br />
Possession of the vessel<br />
Decrepit spawn<br />
Easy prey for the hounds bloodlust calls<br />
Like fire running through our veins<br />
Cries of war <br />
This body be our weapon<br />
This is a call<br />
A call for arms<br />
Rally the minions of the morning star<br />
Let us march in his light towards the enemy<br />
Bring all of hell to his gates to set us free<br />
You send your sheep<br />
The holy man for slaughter<br />
Weak in faith<br />
As he faces his enemy<br />
Belief is shattered<br />
With a devastating blow<br />
Flesh that crumbles<br />
We feast upon his mortal soul<br />
Salvation comes, rape the trinity<br />
Enlighten us, piss on the divinity<br />
Break our chains, defile the virginity<br />
The serpent coils, throughout infinity<br />
This is a call<br />
A call for arms<br />
Rally the minions of the morning star<br />
Let us march in his light towards the enemy<br />
Bring all of hell to his gates to set us free<br />
Trumpets sound, the battle has begun<br />
Reaping death <br />
The sacrifice of blood<br />
The fallen one, ascend from the abyss<br />
Bow your heads for the serpents kiss
