	I am slowly becoming a ruin<br />
A shrine of bones - approaching the lifeless void<br />
<br />
Is that all that will be?<br />
What ever may come,<br />
it must not be fear and doubt<br />
<br />
As long as I will have a will and a word to say,<br />
My will and word will dictate my own way<br />
<br />
As long as I have a will,<br />
I will not mistake apathy for becoming still<br />
That is the thrill - <br />
the path to rise, or vacuously to ruin<br />
<br />
I am slowly becoming a ruin<br />
A shrine of bones - approaching the lifeless void<br />
<br />
As long as I will have a will and a word to say,<br />
My will and word will dictate my own way<br />
<br />
Because this is what we are - <br />
declining flesh and bones leaving a mark
