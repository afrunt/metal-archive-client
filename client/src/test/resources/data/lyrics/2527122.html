	Was long time ago when I had been playing<br />
But never thought I’d be waiting for Death<br />
If I won or I lost, I don’t care<br />
Forget it, checkmate ends the game<br />
<br />
“Once the men had to be demigods<br />
Otherwise they would not have invented the chess”<br />
<br />
Strategy, a matter of reflection<br />
So the tactic is a matter of perception<br />
<br />
Elixir to prolong the life<br />
Cult of wisdom, almost a hymn<br />
To the virtue, the glory and, so, pride<br />
There won’t be such price like enemy’s scalp!<br />
<br />
But the things have changed all at once<br />
At the moment I looked to the adversary mate<br />
…No eyes, they’re just full of scrawls<br />
A little child who’s standing the challenge with me<br />
The son I once had!<br />
Blitz game for me!<br />
<br />
Do not ever leave your last game<br />
Chessboards not allowed<br />
<br />
I had fallen into this fake trap<br />
Death defeated me<br />
<br />
The ambush have penalized me with my life<br />
Cause no one overcomes death<br />
<br />
Checkmate!!!
