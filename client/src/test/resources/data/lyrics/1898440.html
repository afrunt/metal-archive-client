	On the shores of lakes and streams<br />
Awaits (sic) the heathen gods<br />
As we sail through their lands<br />
To the death of mankind<br />
No remorse, no change of course<br />
Row against the up-stream<br />
We have come for what is yours<br />
Join our kingdom of slumber<br />
<br />
Raise one more outcry<br />
We have lost our hope<br />
And come and take yours<br />
Once great and untouchable<br />
Shattered in pieces like the dignity<br />
Of the hypocrites hiding in devotion<br />
<br />
Men will come and men will go<br />
Yet who will serve forevermore<br />
Fading images of icons<br />
Will fade for reason<br />
Men will come and men will go<br />
I might have stayed for a while<br />
Just to see the ruins<br />
Of the kingdom of slumber<br />
<br />
Raise one more outcry<br />
You have not lost your hope<br />
Come to take what is yours<br />
Once great and untouchable<br />
Shattered in pieces like their dignity<br />
Fall - kingdom of slumber
