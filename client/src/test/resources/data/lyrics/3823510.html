	Of helium and hydrogen <br />
Exploding indifferent <br />
<br />
Here we are <br />
Children <br />
Of a huge mass <br />
<br />
Gradually shaping us <br />
Molded to radiation <br />
<br />
Here we are <br />
Children <br />
Nothing else <br />
<br />
The true creationism <br />
Nothing abstract <br />
Our substrate built <br />
By generous energy
