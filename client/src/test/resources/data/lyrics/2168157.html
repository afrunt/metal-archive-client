	Iâ€™ve seen the darkest sky of all<br />
inside the temple of my mind<br />
I watch the black smoke rising up<br />
from the part of me I sacrificed <br />
<br />
My  feet have bled <br />
on the path of  Sacrilege<br />
only resting <br />
to watch the beauty of  the faithful falling<br />
<br />
Embracing the void of god <br />
with the hope left in their hearts <br />
not yet found betrayed<br />
<br />
My  feet run red<br />
on the path of  Sacrilege<br />
only resting <br />
to watch the beauty of  the faithful falling<br />
<br />
Driven by  the greed  for immortality<br />
the true intent of the holy <br />
the sick unable to purge the thoughts of cure<br />
for the incurable from their minds<br />
I pity the scavenger dogs of this world<br />
belligerently  holding on to  <br />
the carcass eternity<br />
<br />
My  feet have bled <br />
on the path of  Sacrilege<br />
My  feet run red<br />
on the path of  Sacrilege
