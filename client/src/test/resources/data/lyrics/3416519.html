	Phosphorus birth, as time stood still<br />
Brought to life in radiant shine, so bright it burned the earth<br />
Rays of light that cut through time<br />
The stars align, the time has come of uneartly matter<br />
Devourer of the universe <br />
Form beyond comprehension<br />
The children of the great lord<br />
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!<br />
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!<br />
The great city, built in sacrificial blood<br />
A monument of our bewinged all-father<br />
Descended into the depths of oblivion<br />
A cenotaph, a tomb for your endless slumber<br />
Of unearthly matter<br />
Devourer of the universe<br />
Form beyond comprehension<br />
The children of the great lord<br />
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!<br />
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!<br />
We summon thee, tentacled majesty<br />
High priest of the great old ones<br />
Awaken from your slumber<br />
Ascend from the depths<br />
Break the chains of time<br />
As the gates of the universe slowly opens wide<br />
Unleash your cosmic powers, enslave mankind<br />
Chaos is the new world order, watch our sanity decline<br />
Spread your wings triumphantly<br />
Of unearthly matter<br />
Devourer of the universe<br />
Form beyond comprehension<br />
The children of the great lord<br />
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!<br />
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!<br />
We summon thee, tentacled majesty<br />
High priest of the great old ones<br />
Awaken from your slumber<br />
Ascend from the depths, break the chains of time<br />
We give our lives for you<br />
This will be our sacrifice<br />
Devour our minds<br />
Feast upon our sanity<br />
Walk the earth again, our lord<br />
Drape the world in horrid madness<br />
Cast your shadow over the universe once more
