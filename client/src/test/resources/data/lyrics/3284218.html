	No perfectness has been reached<br />
until the potential is no more<br />
The seeker of all will find nothing<br />
and the nothingness will appear to all<br />
<br />
And this is the conclusion?<br />
Introduction to who I am not<br />
To outlive a being<br />
whose purposes are none?<br />
<br />
It is waste of time to leave one aim short<br />
Still, what there might be to learn -<br />
could be a failure, or another page to turn<br />
<br />
...but if one is to be all, then all will vanish at once<br />
When this has been discovered, there will remain none<br />
And even now that I wrote this - I do exist<br />
For we are the lucid of our creation -<br />
the cosmos and the chaos in it<br />
<br />
Therefore, the only conclusion is<br />
that we are the one called god<br />
<br />
We should not stop at any death<br />
that we become aware of -<br />
For it is not even ours<br />
that we will be part of<br />
<br />
...but if one is to be all, then all will vanish at once<br />
When this has been discovered, there will remain none<br />
And even now that I wrote this - I do exist<br />
For we are the lucid of our creation -<br />
the cosmos and the chaos in it<br />
<br />
Therefore, the only conclusion is<br />
that we are the one called god<br />
It is only what we have felt, that we believe in<br />
The world is within us and thus; the life lust
